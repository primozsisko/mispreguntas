TEAM DEVELOPMENT MEMBERS:

DESCRIPTION:
QUIZZER is a platform that allows us to create questions of test type. With this we can evaluate a series of acquired knowledge, evaluate other people, keep a record of our scores and it also allows us to share these tests with other people of interest, etc. 

We have also thought about those teachers, who want to keep a record and thus be able to verify and guarantee the knowledge acquired by their students. For this we will be adding a possibility of being able to configure a series of roles.
